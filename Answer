* isAnagram function is in Anagram class
* Factory design pattern is used.
(a) * Create Car class and extends Vehicle. Overide the interface methods
    * Create Plane class and extends Vehicle. Overide the interface methods
    * Create a class called VehicleFactory and add a method which 
      accept parameter as String for vehicleType("Car" or "Plane") and returns
      Vehicle. 
(b) Prototype design pattern can be used
    * Create a abstract class("VehicleAbstract") which implements Cloneable and Vehicle
    * Add a method which returns Object by calling super.clone()
    * Create Car class and extends VehicleAbstract. Overide all interface methods.
      Call them from the constructor. 
    * Create Plane class and extends VehicleAbstract. Overide all interface methods.
      Call them from the constructor. 
    * Create another class called ("VehicleStore"). Using static block add Car and Plane
      objects to a Static HashMap. 
    * Add a static method input parameter as String and base on string value 
      return Vehicle or Car.
